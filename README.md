## 📡 Further Nmap

---
#### 🧭 Objectives
- Deepen understanding of Nmap’s advanced scanning capabilities.
- Learn how to identify services, operating systems, and vulnerabilities.
- Explore stealth techniques and script automation.

#### 🧠 Skills Explored
- TCP, SYN, UDP, and ICMP scan types.
- Using NULL, FIN, and Xmas scans for evasion.
- Leveraging NSE scripts for service enumeration and vulnerability detection.
- Firewall evasion and scan optimization.

#### 🛠️ Tools Overview
- `Nmap` – with advanced flags and script engine.
- `NSE` – Nmap Scripting Engine for automation.
- TryHackMe scan-only VM – safe target for experimentation.

#### 🔄 Steps to Remember (_Advanced Scanning_)
1. **Scan Types** – TCP Connect, SYN, UDP, ICMP.
2. **Stealth Scans** – NULL, FIN, Xmas.
3. **Script Usage** – NSE for service and vulnerability detection.
4. **Firewall Evasion** – Timing, decoys, fragmentation.
5. **Practical Walkthrough** – Apply techniques on a live target.
